Student Number: 3FF8D07459EC440628F2811207257C9E
32 Bit String with same CRC32 Value: 000000000000000000000001CB5BBE51
Found 2nd Collision: 000000000000000000000003C5C743AC
The Matching CRC32 Value: 0xA402F581

Run Time:  
	- 7hours, 21mins on a single process that ran 5.1 billion combinations.
	- Then 56 minutes on a multiprocess search that ran to 2.6 billion more combinations.
	- Second Collision Occurred 1 hour and 33 minutes after the first collision.

Procedure:
- First I ran a search algorithm based off of quesiton 3 that compared my CRC32 value of my MD5 Student Number with a randomly generated 32 bit Hex String.
- After about 5 hours, I gave up on the algorithm because using random is not efficient as it can have repeated strings tested.
- Then I changed my algorithm go increment from 0x00000000000000000000000000000000 to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
- I ran this search over night for around 7 hours and 21minutes with no collision.
- Then I made my search algorithm search with multiple proccesses.
- It took just under an hour to search 2.6 billion more combinations from where I left off with the previous algorithm that ran 5.1 billion combinations.
- After about 13 hours of machine searching, I was able to design a faster algorithm to search for collisions that match my MD5 Student Number.
- Because the search took a long time, I utilized my desktop at home which computes much faster. 
- Because I am at school, I set up email notifications periodically to reassure the search did not crash and once it finished it emails the time and string that caused the collision.
