const-string v8, "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"

    invoke-static {v8}, Ljavax/crypto/Cipher;->getInstance(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljavax/crypto/Cipher;

    method its called in a function called decrypt along with a hex byte 1 passed in as a parameter. From Java crypto library, hex 1 is decrypt mode.

mode of operation: DECRYPT_MODE

Key; 	0x46t
        0x41t

IV: 
.local v1, "iv":[B
    invoke-virtual {v4, v1}, Ljava/security/SecureRandom;->nextBytes([B)V

    comes from secureRandom

5) Because it is using CBC there is not integrity checking unless they prouct a HMAC later on in the code.
6) To fix this I would make the ciper into AES/GCM/PKCS5Padding, this way there is integrity checking
